# ACT - Always Closing Tasks 

The To Do App that is designed to finish. 

Help yourself get more done by tracking the idea and task as soon as it comes to thought. Use this app to track things you want to get done. You can add as many catergories as you want. Once you select that category, you can add the tasks that are related to that category. When you really start getting more and more tasks lined up, you can always search for the items you want and find it with ease. 

This project is my version of a To Do list app that has basic UITableView functions with more advance coding to open up more features. Folllowing the MVC practices, I was able to code this project with readable and reusable methods that can be built on to expand functionality.
